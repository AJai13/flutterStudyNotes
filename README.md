# 勉強ノート
I made this repository to hold notes, commands and terms about flutter.


# Commands:

```
# create flutter project:
flutter create <projectname>

# check flutter installation:
flutter doctor -v

# run project:
flutter run

# check emulators:
flutter emulators

# launch emulator:
flutter emulators --launch <emulatorname>
```
